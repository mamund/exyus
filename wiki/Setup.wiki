==Installing Exyus==
Once the prerequisite items are installed, you can move on to setting up *Exyus*. Below is the recommended process:
===Set up the File Space===
  * Create a folder on disk to hold the *Exyus* web ({{{c:\exyus\}}})
  * Copy the contents of the "exyus_runtime" zip set into the target directory
===Configure IIS===
For these next steps, use the IIS Management Tool
  * Create a new VDir called "xcs" that points to the target folder ({{{c:\exyus\}}})
  * Open the Properties window for this new VDir and on the Virtual Directory tab, make sure to set this folder  with an "Application Name" (Exyus)
  * Click on the "Configuration" button. On the "Mappings" tab, click the "Add" button. Browse to the ASP.NET 2.0 DLL; enter {{{.xcs}}} as the extention; select "All Verbs" radio; check ON "Script Engine"; check OFF "Check that file exists" and press "OK" to save your changes.
  * On the Directory Security Tab, Anonymous Acces... section select "Edit" button. When the dialog pops up, make sure only "Anonymous Access" is selected. Do not use Digest, Basic, or Integrated security
  * Press OK to save your changes for the root folder.
  * In the folder list for this VDir, right-click on the "storage" folder and select "Properties" from the context menu.
  * On the "Directory" tab, check ON "Write" radio button and press "OK" to save your changes.
